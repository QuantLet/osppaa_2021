Description: "The Quantlet loads necessary data and packages, performs a fixed effects regression on normalized data, saves the model, and then performs various diagnostic tests on the residuals, such as checking for serial correlation, cross-sectional correlation, normal distribution, heteroskedasticity, and plotting autocorrelation functions for each level of 'coin' in the data. Includes Dummies. For plotting engine see Quantlet osppaa_2021_model_tables_to_latex."
