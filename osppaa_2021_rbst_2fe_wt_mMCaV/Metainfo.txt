Published in: 'On Stablecoin Price Processes and Arbitrage (Pernice, 2021)'

Description: "The Quantlet performs a fixed effects estimation on the normalized data. A regression model is specified with the dependent variable being the lead of the difference of prices and several independent variables and interaction terms. The 'plm' function from the 'plm' package is used to estimate the model considering 'within' model (or fixed effects model), and 'two-way' effects. The summary of the model is then obtained considering heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) standard errors using the 'vcovSCC' function."

Keywords: Fixed Effects Estimation, Regression, Interaction terms, plm, Within model, Two-Way effects, HAC standard errors
